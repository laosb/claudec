  /// error. Those are not acceptable for a migration whose success gets recorded:
  /// a symlink out of the profile could have redirected a `chown` at anything the

  /// - opens directories relative to their parent's descriptor, so a component
  ///   cannot be swapped out underneath it mid-walk;
  /// - never follows a symlink, either to descend or to change ownership;
  /// - never crosses onto another filesystem, so a nested mount inside the profile
  ///   is left alone;
  /// - resolves entries with `fstatat` rather than trusting `d_type`, which is
  ///   `DT_UNKNOWN` on plenty of filesystems;
  /// - changes ownership only where it actually differs;
  /// - collects errors and reports them, rather than reporting success.
